    <p class="story-text">Liam, a software engineer from Seattle, and Isabella, a classically trained cellist from Boston, both signed up for MatchAI not expecting much. But the AI saw what they didn’t: their shared love for complexity, quiet mornings, and Rachmaninoff. After three weeks of chatting and one spontaneous meetup in Chicago, they realized the algorithm had seen into their souls. Two years later, they played a duet — code and cello — at their wedding.</p>
    <p class="story-text">Theo, a Brooklyn barista with a love of slam poetry, wasn’t expecting much from MatchAI. But then he matched with Julian, a PhD student studying 19th-century literature in Chicago. The AI had picked up on their mutual love of verse, emotional vulnerability, and 2 a.m. existential questions. After exchanging audio poems for weeks, they finally met. Their first date was in a used bookstore — and they never stopped writing together.</p>
